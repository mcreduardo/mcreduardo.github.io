<p>I was born and raised in Brasília, capital of Brazil, where I completed a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in Automation and Controls Engineering at Universidade de Brasília.
During that time, I got the opportunity to be part of many fun projects, from the design and construction of UAVs to the programming of humanoid robots for soccer competitions.
For one of those years, I was a fully-funded scholarship recipient through the Brazil Scientific Mobility Program. I recieved the opportunity to study abroad at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I got imersed into agriculture for the first time.</p>

<p>I met Dr. Brian Luck and the <a href="https://wimachineryextension.bse.wisc.edu/">Badger Ag Tech Lab</a> during the final project of a CS class, in which I worked with one of his past grad students. We developed a method to assess corn kernel particle size distribution through image analysis, which resulted in a publication and a published app available for the farming community (SilageSnap).
After getting in touch with the agicultural field, I was surprised and amazed by how technologically advanced it is, its relevancy, and how much investment for research there is. I became more involved in the lab and decided to get a Master&rsquo;s degree in Biological Systems Engineering.</p>

<p>Throughout the Master&rsquo;s program, I was able to take many graduate level courses, including Machine Learning, Statistics, and Modern Control Theory. I also worked as a Research Assistant for the University, and completed my thesis &ldquo;Assessing corn kernel particle size distribution in chopped and processed corn silage via image analysis&rdquo;, where I focused on Computer Vision and Machine Learning topics.</p>

<p>I am currently working as an engineer for one of the biggest agricultural machinery manufacturers in the world, focusing on the automation of processes.</p>

<p>In my free time, when I am not working on side projects for fun, I love to watch and practice sports. I am passionate about soccer, and I love to be outdoors. From hiking to mountain biking, if the weather allows it, chances are that I am outside.</p>
