<p>I am originally from Brasília, Brazil, where I completed a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in Automation and Control Engineering at Universidade de Brasília.
During that time, I got the opportunity to be part of many fun projects, from the design and construction of UAVs to the programming of humanoid robots for soccer competitions.
For one of those years, I was a fully-funded scholarship recipient through the Brazil Scientific Mobility Program. I recieved the opportunity to study abroad at University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I got imersed with the Ag Engineering field for the firt time.</p>

<p>I met my current advisor, <a href="https://bse.wisc.edu/staff/luck-brian/">Dr. Brian Luck</a>, and the <a href="https://wimachineryextension.bse.wisc.edu/">Badger Ag Tech Lab</a> during a final project of a CS class, in which one of his past grad students was part of. For that project, we developed a method to assess corn kernel particle size distribution through image analysis, which resulted in a publication and a published app available for farmers (SilageSnap link here).
After getting in touch with the agricultural field as an automation and control engineer, I was amazed with the many possible applications of automation. Since then I have become more involved in the lab and decided to join the Biological Systems Engineering Master’s program!</p>

<p>I am currently working towards my MS degree in Biological Systems Engineering with focus on machine learning applications. Throughout this program, I&rsquo;ve been able to take many graduate level courses, including Machine Learning, Statistics, and Modern Control Theory. I work as a Research Assistent for the University.</p>

<p>In my free time, when I am not working on side projects, I love to watch and practice sports. I am passionate about soccer <img src="https://mcreduardo.github.io/images/santos_tn.png" width="25" align="top">, and I love to be outdoors. From hiking to mountain biking, if the weather allows, chances are that I am outside.</p>
