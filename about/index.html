Eduardo is originally from Brasilia, Brazil where he completed a bachelor’s degree in automation and control engineering at the Universidade de Brasilia. During his time there he complete in the Laboratory of Aerial Robotics, designing and fabricating autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles for the implementation of algorithms for cooperative control of multiple aircrafts. In addition, he also projected and implemented an algorithm to calibrate IMUs using a gyroscope."/>

<p>Eduardo is originally from Brasilia, Brazil where he completed a bachelor’s degree in automation and control engineering at the Universidade de Brasilia.  During his time there he complete in the Laboratory of Aerial Robotics, designing and fabricating autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles for the implementation of algorithms for cooperative control of multiple aircrafts. In addition, he also projected and implemented an algorithm to calibrate IMUs using a gyroscope.</p>

<p>He is currently earning a M.S. in Biological Systems Engineering here at UW-Madison. As a student here he designed and fabricated a medical injection pump for use in 4D Neuroangiography in the Wisconsin Institutes for Medical Research.  While working on a final project in an Image Processing course, Eduardo was introduced to our lab and found an interest in agriculture. Eduardo has been a Research Assistant in this lab since January 2018, and will graduate in December of 2019.</p>

<p>In his free time he enjoys playing soccer and mountain biking, reading, creating small design projects, and playing the piano.</p>

<p>“As an automation and control engineer I was amazed with the many possible applications of automation in this field. Since then I have become more involved in the lab and decided to join the BSE Master’s program!”</p>
